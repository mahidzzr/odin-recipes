    <h1><em>Chicken Fry</em></h1>
    <h3><strong>Description</strong></h3>
    <p>Chicken Fry is a popular dish known for its crispy, flavorful exterior and juicy, tender meat inside. This dish involves marinating chicken pieces in a blend of spices and sometimes yogurt, then frying them until they achieve a golden-brown, crispy coating. Chicken fry can vary in flavor profiles depending on regional spices and ingredients, but it always delivers a satisfying crunch and rich taste.</p>
    <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500g chicken pieces (preferably drumsticks or thighs)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup yogurt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ginger-garlic paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garam masala powder</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>2-3 green chilies, slit</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons rice flour (optional, for extra crispiness)</li>
        <li>1 cup oil (for deep frying)</li>
        <li>Fresh coriander leaves (for garnish)</li>
        <li>Lemon wedges (for serving)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric powder, red chili powder, cumin powder, coriander powder, garam masala powder, salt, and lemon juice.</li>
        <li>Add chicken pieces to the marinade, ensuring they are well coated.</li>
        <li>Cover and refrigerate for at least 1-2 hours, or overnight for best results.</li>
        <li>If using, coat the marinated chicken pieces with rice flour for extra crispiness.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep frying pan or wok over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Once the oil is hot, carefully add the marinated chicken pieces to the pan, a few at a time, without overcrowding.</li>
        <li>Fry until the chicken is golden brown and cooked through, turning occasionally to ensure even cooking. This should take about 10-15 minutes per batch.</li>
        <li>Remove the fried chicken pieces and drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh coriander leaves.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with lemon wedges and green chilies on the side. Enjoy your Bengali Chicken Fry! </li>
