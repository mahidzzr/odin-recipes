    <h1><em>Milk Egg Caramel Pudding</em></h1>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p class="recipe-info">Milk Egg Caramel Pudding, also known as crème caramel or flan, is a classic dessert characterized by its smooth, creamy texture and rich caramel flavor. The dessert features a layer of golden, sweet caramel sauce atop a soft and silky custard base made from milk, eggs, and sugar. The custard is baked in a water bath to ensure even cooking and a delicate, jiggly consistency. When served, the pudding is inverted onto a plate, allowing the caramel to flow over the custard, creating a delightful contrast between the creamy custard and the sweet, slightly bitter caramel.</p>
