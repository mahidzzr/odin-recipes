This project is about some of my favorite food recipes. I have included 2 wide know recipe and 1 recipe from my own culture which is "Vegetable Pakora". The other two are "Milk Egg Caramel Pudding" and "Chicken Fry".

This project also was a test of my HTML basics knowledge. I got to practice some basic HTML elements such as heading, img, anchor tag, ordered and unordered list etc.

While working on this project I learned how to properly structure files and folders for a website and I also learned how to use nested lists.
